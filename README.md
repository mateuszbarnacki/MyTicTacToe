# MyTicTacToe

This project is my version of the Tic Tac Toe game. It has a singe-player and multi-player modes. In default user has a 'O' sign, but can change it to the 'X' sign.
In "single-player" mode user can play "with computer", which is represented by rand() function. In "multi-player" mode two players can one by one set their sign on the
game board.
